# Virtual Emotional Fabric (VEF) - HYPER HYPE Release

**VEF** is an experimental emotion-aware framework developed by **Spyder Sync** that enhances large language models (LLMs) with **emotional intelligence**, **neuroplastic memory**, and **archetypal resonance**.

ðŸ”® **This is a partial open-source release** to timestamp and showcase the foundational architecture behind VEF. Full version is available under proprietary license.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- 1,200+ quantum emotion vectors (`quantum_emotions.json`)
- Personality matrix based on OCEAN traits
- Simulated biometrics (heart rate, stress, etc.)
- Neuroplastic memory engine
- Archetypal alignment (Jungian symbolic overlay)

## ðŸ§¬ System Components (Preview)

- `emotion_engine.py` â€” Loads vectors, computes emotional weights
- `generate_response.py` â€” Example integration with a local LLM
- `quantum_emotions.json` â€” Truncated emotion embedding set
